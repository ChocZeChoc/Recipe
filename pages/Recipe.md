			- Teaspoon = tsp
			- ml = millilitres
			- L = litres
			- For quick estimate: Paste 1 Tbsp \approx 30g , Liquids 1 Tbsp \approx 15ml, Powder 1 Tbsp \approx 6g (For bigger grains 12g)
			- US Volumes are roughly equal to Metric volume; 1 Tbsp(Metric) \approx 1 Tbsp(US), 1 tsp \approx 1 tsp.
		- [[Conversion]]
			- [[Temperature]]
				- $C\degree=\frac{(F\degree-32)\cdot5}{9}$
